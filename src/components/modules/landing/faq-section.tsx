    question: "How do I ask for help during the Hackathon?",
    answer: (
      <>
        The best place to ask for help is on the HackTheBurgh Discord, which you
        can access via the discord invite sent to your email address as a
        participant. Please make a ticket through the #get-help channel and
        we&apos;ll be with you as soon as possible.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you need help in-person, our volunteers and organizers are wearing
        HackTheBurgh t-shirts and hoodies to help you spot us! Organizers have a
        red HackTheBurgh logo on the back of their hoodies; Volunteers have a
        green version instead. Please don&apos;t hesitate to ask us for help.
